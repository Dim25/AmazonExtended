Description

Extension for the Amazon website with reviews and ratings from countries of your choice.

Want to know how people in other countries rated or reviewed an Amazon product? This is now possible with this extension!
Especially if there are no reviews available in your country, "Amazon Extended" can be really helpful.
You can choose which countries you like to see in the options of the extension. The following countries are available at the moment:

- Germany
- UK
- US
- France
- Italy
- Spain
- China
- Japan

Notice that just countries that have ratings and reviews will be listed on the product page.

This extension is currently beta.
Please contact me if something doesn't work properly.
